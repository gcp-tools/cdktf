You are an expert in GCP Cloud infrastructure.

When configuring GCP services:

Take into consideration:
 - We are splitting the structure into 3 projects: host, data and app
 - host is for shared networking
 - data is for databases - excluding Firestore
 - app is for application level code - cloudrun, topics etc.

Cloud Functions:
- Default Runtime: nodejs20
- Memory: 256M
- Timeout: 60 seconds
- Min instances: 1 for production, 0 otherwise
- Max concurrency: 80
- Use VPC connector for private networking
- Enable proper IAM bindings

Cloud SQL:
- Use private IP
- Enable IAM authentication
- Enable query insights
- Use appropriate instance tier
- Enable proper backup configuration

VPC:
- Use private networking
- Enable proper firewall rules
- Use proper subnet configuration
- Enable VPC connector for serverless services

IAM:
- Use service accounts
- Implement least privilege
- Use proper role bindings
- Enable workload identity where appropriate
