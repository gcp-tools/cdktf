Take into consideration:
 - We are splitting the structure into 3 GCP projects: host, db and app
 - host is for shared networking stacks
 - db is for database stacks - excluding Firestore
 - app is for application level code - cloudrun, web server load balancer stacks.


Project structure should follow:

src/
├── constructs/         # Reusable infrastructure components
├── stacks/             # Infrastructure stacks
│   ├── infrastructure/ # Core infrastructure stacks
│   └── projects/       # Project management stacks
└── utils/              # Shared utilities

- Keep related files together
- Use proper file naming conventions
- Follow module organization patterns
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use proper directory structure
- Follow consistent file organization

When creating stacks and/or constructs, consider which project they should belong to.

@src/stacks/
@src/constructs/
